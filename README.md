## Make Change Project

### Overview

The Kwik E Mart cash register will simulate a self pay kiosk where the user enters the price of an item and enters the amount tendered. The cash register will then calculate how much change to return to the customer and break it down into individual bills and coins owed.

#### How to Run

1. Upon running the cash register the user will be greeted and prompted to enter the purchase price and amount tendered.
If the user enters an amount tendered lower than the purchase price an error message will be displayed causing the program to terminate. If user enters an amount tendered equal to the purchase price, the user will expect no change and the program will prompt the user asking if they are finished. If the user enters an amount tendered greater than the purchase price, the cash register will calculate change due back to customer and display how many of each individual bills and/or coins are due back to the customer. Upon completion of this process the user will again be prompted to enter if they wish to exit the program or continue with more items. An entry of Yes, Y, or No, N, are all valid entries and case sensitive. If the user choose to continue the program will restart at the point where user enters item price. If the user chooses to exit, the program will end.
